# How to build and execute?

The following convention is assumed: In the folder `~/abgabe/codea` are all the files (makefile, sourcefiles) necessary to build and execute the program (see the general `README.md` of this repo for clarification).

If this condition is satisfied, the one can run the test cases by `./run.sh` (one might need to change permissions of this file, e.g. by `chmod +x run.sh`). This will build the `codea` program and then execute the tests.
