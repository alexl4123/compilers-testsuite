The following convention is assumed: There exists an executable program which is named `ag` and is in the location specified as in the general `README.md` of this repo.

If this condition is satisfied, one can execute the tests via `./run.sh` (one might need to change permissions of this file, e.g. by `chmod +x run.sh`).
