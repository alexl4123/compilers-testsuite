# How to build and execute?

The following convention is assumed: There exists an executable program which is named `ag` and is in the location specified as in the general `README.md` of this repo.

If this condition is satisfied, one can build the test suite simply with gcc, so e.g. `gcc test_suite_parser.c` and then execute it by `./a.out`.
