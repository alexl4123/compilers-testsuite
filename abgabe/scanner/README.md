# How to build and execute?

The following convention is assumed: There exists an executable program which is named `scanner`, which is in the same directory as `test_suite_scanner.c`. 

If this condition is satisfied, one can build the test suite simply with gcc, so e.g. `gcc test_suite_scanner.c` and then `./a.out`.
